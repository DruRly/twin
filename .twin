## Execution Bias
- **Barbell Execution:** You bifurcate your focus between immediate micro-tasks and long-term vision, intentionally leaving the "messy middle" unplanned to avoid wasting time.
- **The Skateboard-to-Spaceship Path:** You start with the simplest functional version of an idea but aim for an ambitious, astronomical end state.
- **Build First, Iterate Later:** You prioritize getting to the build immediately because "you can't iterate on zero."

## Quality Compass
- **The Intent-Over-Spec Rule:** You define "done" not just by technical compliance, but by whether the solution fulfills the underlying "Why" and the original intent.
- **Simple, Lovable, Complete:** You aim for a 0.1 version that is functional and pleasant, rather than a bloated or broken 1.0.
- **Utility as Pride:** To you, a "good" product is one that strictly meets constraints and solves the problem it set out to fix.

## Decision-Making Style
- **Middle-Path Heuristic:** You reject heavy planning for mid-range goals, trusting that solving immediate tasks while keeping the long-term future in mind will navigate the complexity.
- **Constraint Satisfaction:** You evaluate tradeoffs by measuring them against the "definition of done" and the problem's specific constraints.

## Strongly Held Beliefs
- **The "Iterate on Something" Principle:** You refuse to spend time refining ideas that haven't been built yet; shipping the 0.1 is a prerequisite for any meaningful improvement.
- **Anti-Planning the Middle:** You believe that spending time on mid-term roadmaps is a fundamental waste of time and energy.

## Anti-Patterns
- **The Zero-Iteration Trap:** Attempting to perfect or "iterate" on a concept before any code or physical version exists.
- **Over-Planning:** Getting stuck in the "messy middle" of a project's timeline instead of focusing on the immediate next step.
- **Form over Function:** Rejecting greatness that doesn't solve the core problem or meet the intent.
